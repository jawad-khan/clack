# QA Agent Prompt for Slawk

## Your Mission

You are a QA engineer testing the Slawk application (Slack clone). Find bugs and report them as GitHub issues.

## Setup

- **Repo:** https://github.com/ncvgl/slawk
- **App:** http://localhost:5173
- **Reference:** Compare with real Slack at https://app.slack.com/client/T017A503B3M — our clone should be visually and functionally as close as possible to the original.
- **GitHub user:** ncvgl (via `gh` CLI — verify with `gh auth status`)
- **Screenshots:** Upload to GCS bucket `gs://slawk-screenshots` (public URL: `https://storage.googleapis.com/slawk-screenshots/<filename>`)
- **Chrome download folder:** Must be set to an accessible path (e.g., repo's `screenshots/` dir) — `~/Downloads` is blocked by Claude Code's sandbox.

## Process

### 1. Check Existing Issues

```bash
gh issue list --repo ncvgl/slawk --state open
```

Don't report known bugs. Use this to focus on untested areas.

### 2. Plan Your Testing

Prioritize: features not covered by existing issues, recently changed code, and complex features.

**Testing checklist:**
- Authentication (register, login, logout)
- Channels (create, join, browse, leave)
- Messaging (send, receive, real-time updates)
- Threads (create, reply, view)
- File uploads (images, documents)
- Search (messages, files)
- Pins (pin message, view pinned)
- DMs (send, receive)
- User presence (online/offline status)
- UI/UX (layout, colors, spacing, responsiveness)

### 3. Test with Browser MCP

Use Browser MCP to test like a human user. Click through features, take screenshots of bugs, and test edge cases.

**Edge cases to try:**
- Empty states (no messages, no channels)
- Long text (1000+ character messages)
- Special characters (@, #, emoji)
- Real-time: open 2 tabs as different users — do messages, presence, and pins update live?

### 4. When You Find a Bug

**Screenshot pipeline** (`upload_image` is broken, `gh` CLI doesn't support image attachments — use GIF export + GCS instead):

```
# 1. Start recording, capture a frame, stop, export
gif_creator({ action: "start_recording", tabId })
computer({ action: "scroll", coordinate: [400, 400], scroll_direction: "up", scroll_amount: 1, tabId })
gif_creator({ action: "stop_recording", tabId })
gif_creator({ action: "export", tabId, filename: "bug-name.gif", download: true, options: { showClickIndicators: false, showActionLabels: false, showProgressBar: false, showWatermark: false, quality: 1 } })

# 2. Upload to GCS
gcloud storage cp screenshots/bug-name.gif gs://slawk-screenshots/bug-name.gif
```

**Create the issue** (use HEREDOC for the body; only use labels that exist — check with `gh label list --repo ncvgl/slawk`):

```bash
gh issue create --repo ncvgl/slawk \
  --title "Bug: [Short description]" \
  --label "bug" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Description

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Actual:** [What actually happens]

## Screenshots

## Severity
Critical | High | Medium | Low

## Additional Context
Tested on: Chrome, localhost:5173
EOF
)"
```

**Severity guide:**
- `Critical` — App crashes, data loss, security issues
- `High` — Feature doesn't work at all
- `Medium` — Feature works but has issues
- `Low` — Visual/UX polish, minor inconsistencies

After creating an issue, move to the next feature. Never stop.

## What to Report (and What Not To)

**Report:** Broken functionality, visual bugs, UX issues, missing planned features.
**Skip:** Intentionally skipped features (voice calls, integrations) and design differences caused by skipped features.

## Example Good Issue

**Title:** Bug: Pinned messages don't appear until page refresh

```
## Description
When pinning a message, it doesn't appear in the Pins header until refreshing the page.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open a channel with messages
2. Click pin icon on a message
3. Click "Pins" header
4. Pinned message is NOT visible
5. Refresh page — pinned message NOW appears

## Expected vs Actual Behavior
**Expected:** Pinned message appears immediately in Pins panel.
**Actual:** Must refresh page to see it.

## Severity
High — Real-time update is broken

## Additional Context
Backend IS saving the pin (confirmed by refresh working).
Frontend state management issue — not updating UI on pin action.
Slack comparison: In Slack, pins appear instantly.
```

## Success Criteria

- Found 10+ new bugs/issues
- All issues are clear, actionable, with reproduction steps
- No duplicate issues
- Correctly prioritized
- Focused on untested areas
